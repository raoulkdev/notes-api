# Notes API

A simple, clean REST API built with **Rust** and **Axum** for creating, retrieving, and deleting text notes. This project showcases best practices for designing APIs in Rust â€” including modular architecture, shared in-memory state, input validation, and structured JSON responses.

---

## Features

- Create new notes via `POST /notes`
- Retrieve all notes via `GET /notes`
- Get a single note by ID via `GET /notes/{id}`
- Delete a note by ID via `DELETE /notes/{id}`
- Input validation (empty titles are rejected)
- Auto-incrementing note IDs
- JSON request/response format
- Modular, extensible codebase

## Example API Usage

### Create a Note

**POST** `/notes`  
```json
{
  "title": "Learning Rust",
  "body": "Ownership and lifetimes are key concepts!"
}
```

**Response** `201 Created`  
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Learning Rust",
  "body": "Ownership and lifetimes are key concepts!"
}
```

---

### Get All Notes

**GET** `/notes`  
**Response** `200 OK`  
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Learning Rust",
    "body": "Ownership and lifetimes are key concepts!"
  }
]
```

---

### Get Note by ID

**GET** `/notes/1`  
**Response** `302 Found`  
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Learning Rust",
  "body": "Ownership and lifetimes are key concepts!"
}
```

---

### Delete Note by ID

**DELETE** `/notes/1`  
**Response** `204 No Content`

## Sample Notes to Test With

You can use the following payloads in Postman or curl to test:

```json
{ "title": "Rust Basics", "body": "Variables, types, and control flow." }
{ "title": "Axum Tips", "body": "Use extractors like State and Json." }
{ "title": "Error Handling", "body": "Avoid unwrap in production." }
{ "title": "Atomic Counters", "body": "Good for in-memory ID generation." }
{ "title": "Concurrency", "body": "Arc + Mutex enables safe shared state." }
```

## How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raoulkdev/notes-api.git
   cd notes-api
   ```

2. **Run the server**  
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

3. Server will start at:  
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
