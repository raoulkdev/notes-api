> A simple, clean REST API built with **Rust** and **Axum** for creating, retrieving, and deleting text notes. This project showcases best practices for designing APIs in Rust — including modular architecture, shared in-memory state, input validation, and structured JSON responses.

## Features

- Create new notes via `POST /notes`
- Retrieve all notes via `GET /notes`
- Get a single note by ID via `GET /notes/{id}`
- Delete a note by ID via `DELETE /notes/{id}`
- Input validation (empty titles are rejected)
- Auto-incrementing note IDs
- JSON request/response format
- Modular, extensible codebase

## Sample Notes to Test With

You can use the following payloads in Postman or curl to test:

```json
{ "title": "Grocery List", "body": "Milk, eggs, bread, chicken, spinach, coffee." }
{ "title": "Workout Plan - Tuesday", "body": "Deadlifts, pull-ups, overhead press, core work." }
{ "title": "Meeting Notes - July 9", "body": "Discussed Q3 goals, sprint blockers, and deployment plan." }
{ "title": "Daily Journal - July 8", "body": "Learned Axum, went for a walk, felt productive." }
{ "title": "Study Topics for Finals", "body": "Rust ownership, HTTP status codes, SQL joins, async JS." }
```

## How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raoulkdev/notes-api.git
   cd notes-api
   ```

2. **Run the server**  
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

3. Server will start at:  
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
